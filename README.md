# 🧠 Object Localization with Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform object localization using deep learning techniques. It uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect and localize objects within an image by predicting bounding boxes.

## 💡 Problem Statement

Object detection involves two key tasks: classification and localization. In this project, we focus on object localization – determining **where** an object is in the image by predicting its coordinates (bounding box). This is critical for applications like self-driving cars, medical imaging, and robotics.

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🗃️ Dataset

This project uses a synthetic dataset of labeled images, where each label includes:
- Class of the object
- Coordinates for bounding box: (x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max)

(*If using a specific dataset, add its link here or specify its origin*)
